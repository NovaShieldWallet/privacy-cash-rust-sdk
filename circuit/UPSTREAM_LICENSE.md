## License Summary

- **License:** Business Source License 1.1 (BSL)
- **Protection Period:** 2 years from first public release of each version
- **Change License:** GNU General Public License v2.0 or later (GPL-2.0-or-later)

## What You Can Do Today

Under the Business Source License, you **may**:

- View and audit the source code
- Modify the code for research or non-commercial purposes
- Use the software internally within your organization
- Build on top of Privacy Cash without offering a competing product

You **may NOT**:

---

## Commercial Use & Competition

Offering the Licensed Work to third parties on a **hosted, embedded, or paid basis** in a way that competes with Privacy Cash’s paid offerings is **not permitted** during the BSL protection period.

If your use case does not compete (e.g. internal use, non-commercial use, research, unpaid tools), it is allowed.

If you are unsure whether your use qualifies, please reach out.

## License Change (Automatic)

After **two (2) years** from the date a given version is first published:

- The Business Source License **automatically expires**
- That version becomes licensed under:

> **GNU General Public License v2.0 or later (GPL-2.0-or-later)**

No action is required from you or us.

## Why This License

This model balances:
- Transparency and auditability
- Protection against copy-paste competitors
- Long-term commitment to open source

After the protection window, the code is permanently open source under GPL.
